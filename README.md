PD (Persistent Datastructure)
======================
Eonil, 2019.

A collection of some persistent datastructures.



Note
-------
I'm not sure about need for this library.
Aggregation concept is harder to maintain. 



Persistence
--------------
All types are persistent datastructures. Copying cost is always `O(1)`,
and core mutations are all `O(log(n))` regardless whether you make copy or not.
